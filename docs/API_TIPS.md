# API Key Guide

This application uses the Google Gemini API to provide its AI-powered features. To use the tool, you must provide your own API key.

## How to Get Your API Key

2.  **Sign In**: Sign in with your Google account.
3.  **Create API Key**: Click on the "Create API key" button. You may be prompted to create a new Google Cloud project if you don't have one already.
4.  **Copy Your Key**: A new API key will be generated. Copy this key to your clipboard.

## How to Use Your Key in the Application

1.  **Find the Input Field**: On the application's main page, there is a designated section for your API key.
2.  **Paste Your Key**: Paste the key you copied from Google AI Studio into the input field.
3.  **Save the Key**: Click the "Save Key" button. The key will be securely saved in your browser's local storage for the current session. The application is now ready to use.

## Troubleshooting

- **"API Key not valid" Error**: This error means the key you provided is incorrect or has been revoked.
  - Double-check that you copied the entire key correctly.
  - Ensure that the associated Google Cloud project has billing enabled, as API usage may require it.
  - Verify that the "Generative Language API" is enabled in your Google Cloud project.

- **Usage Costs**: Please be aware that using the Google Gemini API is subject to Google's pricing. You are responsible for any costs incurred from your API key usage.
